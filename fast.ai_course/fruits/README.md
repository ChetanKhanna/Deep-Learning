# Green Apple Classifier

This is a web app based on Startlette to showcase a classifier that I developed recently. All thanks to fast.ai for their wonderful [course](https://course.fast.ai) and [Simonw](https://github.com/simonw/cougar-or-not) for the Starlette app.
This was just a practice project so most of the work is inspired/directly taken from the above links.
Thanks and do check out their content!
